#Proposal 1
To create a game clone of Pong 

2 players should be able to move their piece up and down using WASD and the arrow keys respectively

#Library(ies) to Consider
* [ofxGame](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/ofxGame)
* [ofxSDL](https://github.com/leebyron/ofxSDL) for controller/joystick support
* [ofxBox2d](https://github.com/vanderlin/ofxBox2d) possible physics for engine
* sound libraries - 'pong' noises when the ball hits either paddle
* animations for scoring points on either side of screen, like confetti or temporary flashing colors

#Additional Goals (if there is time)
* Add tilting
* Consider drag with tilted paddles
